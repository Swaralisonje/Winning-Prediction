## Project Overview

The Olympics Medal Predictor analyzes Olympic participation and medal-winning patterns for different countries across various sports. Users select a sport, and the app:
- Displays key statistics on top-performing countries.
- Predicts the chances of future medal wins using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
- Presents model performance metrics for comparison.

Embedded Power BI reports provide additional visualizations and insights into the data.

## Features

- **Interactive Sport Selection**: Users can input a specific sport to view relevant data and predictions.
- **Top 10 Countries Statistics**: Ranks countries by win percentage and displays participation, medal count, and predicted winning chances.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Uses Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models to predict medal-winning chances.
- **Model Performance Comparison**: Shows accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for each model.
- **Visualization**: Histogram visualization of win percentages by country, with additional Power BI reports embedded for in-depth analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Flask, Pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Power BI**: Embedded reports for extended data analysis and visualization
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend user interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/olympics-medal-predictor.git](https://github.com/Swaralisonje/Olympics-Winning-prediction/tree/main)
   cd olympics-medal-predictor
Usage

- Select a Sport: Enter a specific sport (e.g., "Swimming") in the input field and submit.
- View Results: After submitting, the app displays:
- Top 10 Countries with details on participation, medals won, and winning chances.
- Model Performance comparison between Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
- Histogram showing win percentages by country.
- Power BI Reports: Embedded Power BI reports provide interactive data analysis and broader insights.

Data Preprocessing

The app processes the Olympic dataset to prepare features:
- Medal_Won: A binary column indicating whether a medal was won (1) or not (0).
- Data is grouped by Team, Year, and Sport to calculate each countryâ€™s total participation, medals won, and win percentage.
- This data is split into features (X) and labels (y) to train and evaluate models.
- 
Model Training

** Naive Bayes:
** Logistic Regression:

Model trained to predict win chances for the selected sport.

* Results and Visualizations

- Top 10 Countries Table: Displays top countries based on win percentage in the selected sport.
  
Model Performance Metrics:

- Identifies the more accurate model.
- Histogram: Visualization of win percentage by country for the selected sport.
- Power BI Reports: Embedded Power BI reports provide in-depth data visualizations.
